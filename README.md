Standardise everything.

Standardisation is a fundamental principle. To go against it requires leverage, means and market majority - only to forever swim against the stream.

Turn all products and appliances into templates, turning them into 'micro-markets' within themselves.

Example: Toothbrush - Template 1.Version 1. [T1V1]
The head of the toothbrush is part 1, the handle is part 2, and the circle symbolises the means to connect them; whether it be a simple screw thread (version 1) or some other (version x).

Use version control to iterate and improve upon each template.

Example code for a single part: #T3V1P4 [#(Template)3(Version)1(Part)4]
